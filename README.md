# Linear-Regression-Project

We are given the dataset meatspec, see https://rdrr.io/cran/faraway/man/meatspec.html for details; we are trying to predict the value of variable f at with some covariates X (as columns) for which there are n i.i.d. measurements (as the rows of the data provided) over p covariates. However, it is not clear whether all the covariates are relevant for the prediction of Y . In this project, we are going to consider several variants of the OLS to make a regressor under this setting and identify relevant variables
